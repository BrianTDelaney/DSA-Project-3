# DSA-Project-3

Purpose of this project:
There are many games now that the gaming market has increased dramatically, making it hard to find games you may like, especially with the abundance of mediocre games. With this app, you can find games similar to the ones you like by simply inputting some games you like.

Implementation:
By using graphs (adjacency list) with the most similar games being adjacent to each other based on tags and publishers, we can recommend games by finding adjacent nodes to that of the inputted games from the user. We also have an AI implementation where the AI scans a map of games and their respective descriptions to recommend games to users based on the description or games that the user likes.

Tools, libraries, and APIs used:
SteamSpy, Steam Web API, OpenAI API, OpenAI Library, Dotenv and os library for API key, Json, Flask, Time library, CSS



How to run the code:

Run the app.py file and click the link that gets outputted in the console.
You will be directed to the website where you can then check out the features.

You can go to the recommender and input at least three games from our database, then press the send button. Click on the link that appears to be taken to a list of recommendations that match your preferences.
After viewing your recommendations you can return to the home screen and view the top-rated games in our database.
